## About Sunereum
Sunereum Labs started with a simple goal in mind: to create data-driven clean energy insurance and reinsurance products with lower premiums and faster payouts for peace of mind and a more resilient power grid. We are building insurance products that leverage real-world energy asset data, proprietary risk algorithms, and smart contracts for payments in days - not months. From personalized risk mitigation strategies to fast claims processing, we've got you covered. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us. We're always looking for ways to improve our clean energy insurance platform, and your input is invaluable.
